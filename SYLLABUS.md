## Computer Organization

This course is about two things:

1. What goes on under the hood.
2. What goes on deeper under the hood.

This will be a project intensive course.

Projects will largely be done in ARM AARCH64 ISA.

### Note to Seniors

This is a required course taught in what is supposed to be your last term here. If you do not pass this course either:

* You will not receive a CS degree if you have another major, or
* You will not graduate if you have no other major

My hands are tied on this. If you fail the course you're well and truly screwed. Full stop.

## Platform

You will install and use a VM emulating an ARM V8 processor running Debian. You can edit code on your main (native) platform.

You will be responsible for learning and using the Linux programming environment.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
| --------- | ------ |
| Midterm   | 15% |
| Final     | 15% |
| Projects  | 70% |

Both exams are cumulative.

| Lower Bound | Upper Bound | Letter Grade |
| ------- | -------- | ---------- |

Again, please note that the scale above may be changed at the instructor's discretion.

### A comment about equity and inclusion

I completely subscribe and agree with the Carthage statements on equity and inclusion. See them [here](https://www.carthage.edu/equity-inclusion/mission-statement/).

### Advising and accommodations

The Carthage Advising Center offers a variety of services and accommodations to students with disabilities, based on appropriate documentation, nature of disability, and academic need. In order to initiate services, students should meet with Diane Schowalter at the start of the semester to discuss reasonable accommodation. After meeting with Diane Schowalter, students in need of accommodations should also speak with individual faculty members from whom accommodations are sought to communicate their needs and make requests in a timely manner. If a student does not request accommodation or provide documentation, the faculty member is under no obligation to provide accommodations. You may contact Diane Schowalter at ext. 5802 or via e-mail at dschowalter1@carthage.edu.

### A note about accessibility

Carthage College strives to make all learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience academic barriers due to your disability (including mental health, learning disorders and chronic medical conditions), please let me know immediately so that we can privately discuss options.  To establish reasonable accommodations, you also need to register with Diane Schowalter in Learning Accessibility Services (dschowalter1@carthage.edu).

### Academic Success and Health

Good health can help you achieve academic success. The Health and Counseling Center (HCC) supports students by addressing physical, mental, and emotional well-being. All services are free and confidential and are provided by experienced and licensed professionals. Services are available to all full-time, undergraduate students.

### Possibility of changes made to the course

Please note the above schedule, policies, procedures and assignments in the course are subject to change in the event of extenuating circumstances, by mutual agreement and / or to encourage better student outcomes.

### Concerning learning outcomes

Students may vary in their competency levels of any stated outcome. Students can expect to achieve stated outcomes only if they honor all course policies, attend classes regularly, complete all assigned work in good faith and on time and meet all other course expectations of them as students.
